# better<kbd>CR</kbd>

#### A complete redesign of Crunchyroll, right in your browser.

A **Chrome (Manifest V3)** extension in **TypeScript**, with **no backend**: it reskins
`crunchyroll.com` with a faster, prettier interface, powered by the **real Crunchyroll API**
and enriched with **AniList**.

## 🚧 Project status

> **BetterCR is not abandoned.**
>
> If updates become less frequent — or temporarily stop — it is because I am actively working on a **major evolution of the project and a substantially improved alternative**, rethought to be better across essentially every aspect.
>
> I am intentionally keeping the details private for now. At the same time, I am also working on **another large-scale private project**, which currently takes a significant amount of my development time.
>
> Most importantly, **the work already done on BetterCR will not be lost**. The features, ideas and improvements introduced here are part of what comes next. Existing functionality is not being thrown away.
>
> When the time is right, the current project will ultimately be replaced by a **final, corrected, more polished and significantly improved version, delivered in a different form**.
>
> So if things seem quiet here for a while: development has not stopped — it has simply moved behind the scenes.

## 🎬 What is it?

**BetterCR** takes over Crunchyroll's UI and replaces it with a rethought design — without
leaving the site or relying on a server. You stay signed into **your own account**; your data
stays with you / Crunchyroll.

> ⚡ Faster, cleaner, prettier · 🧠 AniList-enriched · 🙈 spoiler-free · 🌍 EN & FR

## ✨ Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🎨 **Full redesign** | Home, catalog, series page, search, watchlist, profile |
| 🌍 **Bilingual EN / FR** | Instant switch + localized content via the API |
| 🔐 **Real session** | Reuses your Crunchyroll login · **real** login & logout |
| 🅰️ **AniList enrichment** | Banners, HD covers, scores, genres, studios |
| 🙈 **Anti-spoiler** | Unwatched episodes' thumbnails & titles blurred |
| 📡 **Sorted simulcast** | By most recently added / updated episode |
| ❤️ **Watchlist & favorites** | **Real** add / remove + local favorites |
| 📊 **Profile & stats** | Real name, avatar and watch statistics |
| 💾 **Smart cache** | External APIs (AniList) are cached |
| ⚡ **No backend** | 100% bundled inside the extension |
| 🛟 **Resilience** | *Kill switch*: auto-fallback to the native site if Crunchyroll changes (remote flag + self-detection) |

## 🧩 Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph P["🌐 crunchyroll.com"]
    INJ["injected-script<br/>intercepts the token"]
    CS["content-script<br/>overlay + bridge"]
  end
  APP["BetterCR SPA<br/>React · TypeScript"]
  CR[("Crunchyroll API")]
  ANI[("AniList")]
  INJ --> CS
  CS -->|loads the iframe| APP
  APP -->|postMessage| CS
  CS -->|Bearer + cookies| CR
  APP -->|direct CORS, cached| ANI
```

The React app is served **from the extension** (no server). Since the iframe can't call the CR
API directly (CORS), everything is proxied through the content script, which holds the session
token. The native (DRM) video player is kept.

## 🧰 Stack

`strict TypeScript` · `React 18` · `Vite + @crxjs` · `zod` · `ESLint + Prettier`
Layered architecture inspired by **NASA's Power-of-Ten** rules & the **Google TS Style Guide**.

## 🚀 Install

```bash
cd BetterCR
npm install
npm run build          # builds dist/
```

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. **Load unpacked** → the `BetterCR/dist` folder
4. Visit **crunchyroll.com** (signed in)

## 🔒 Privacy

No backend, no trackers. Your session token never leaves the browser; calls go **directly** to
Crunchyroll (with your cookies) and AniList.

## 🤝 Transparency

Yes, BetterCR is largely *vibe-coded* (built with AI assistance). But it's a project that is
**supervised, reviewed, tested and maintained by a human developer**. Every release goes through a
build, lint and an audit (security, dead code, minimal permissions) before shipping, and fixes land
fast. AI speeds up the work; the decisions, architecture and quality stay human. And since it's all
**open-source**, you can verify it yourself.

respective owners. For personal use.
